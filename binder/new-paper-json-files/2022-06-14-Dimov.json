	"Notes": "Data came from 4 brain slabs – unclear how many subjects; no other information provided for anonymity). A total of 10 lesions (across the 4 slabs) with 3 ROIs each were analyzed. The correlation coefficient had a p-value of 0.005. Each ROI was 3.34 mm, meaning that they contained more than 1 voxel  (voxel size of 0.5 mm isotropic)."
