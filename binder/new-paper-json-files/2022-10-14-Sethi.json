	"Notes": "9 pregnant late gestation female guinea pigs and 31 foetal guinea pigs. Approximately 6 ROIs (round circles ≈1-2 pixels) were placed in the corpus callosum (CC) and 6 in the fornix (FOR). From my understanding, to compare qMRI measures to histology, the MWF and MPB staining intensity (SI) values were averaged within structure-of-interest within subject and across ROIs, such that each subject had 1 MFW and 1 MBP per structure of interest – hence, for the linear regression, there were 2 ROIs / subject. MBP signal intensity converted to optical density."
