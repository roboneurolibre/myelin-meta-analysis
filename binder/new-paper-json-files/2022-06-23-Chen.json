	"Notes": "For MRI measurements, there were 6 ROIs per animal (3 ROIs / sciatic nerve x 2 sciatic nerves). For histoloy measurements, there were 2 ROIs per animal (1 ROI / sciatic nerve made by averaging the measurements from 5 images x 2 sciatic nerves). The paper reports 24 correlations between qMRI and histology measurements: 6 qMRI measurements ( 3 ROIs x 2 MRI measures ) x 4 histology measures ( 1 ROI x {POAA, POMA, TOM, DOM } ) (see Figure 6).  Here, we are reporting the most conservative correlations the RS-5 EPI ROI (reportedly better than RS-3 and RS-7): FA and DOMF, RD and DOMF (note that RD and POAA also had a R^2 of 0.7744)."
